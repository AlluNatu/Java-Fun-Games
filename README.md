# Java is mostly fun

This is mostly my Java repository where I put all/some of my Java writing projects and tests.

Mostly now this is my Java course CT60A2411 Olio-ohjelmointi (Object-oriented programming). Which I passed with a grade 5, from grading scale 1-5. I completed the course in LUT University while doing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.
